welcome to hft!
===============

HFT is a small project with a big ambition. We aim to build the worlds fastest algorithmic trading platform using the best off-the-shelf open source technology stack we can find.

Even better, we are aiming for an overall design that is minimal, simple and robust.  Ultimately, we would like the high-frequency community, whether serious professional or keen amateur enthusiast to look towards hft as the backbone of their next project.

There's not much to see here right now, but check back soon and see how we're doing.
